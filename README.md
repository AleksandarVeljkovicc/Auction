Desktop auction app.
This app has 2 users: administrator and regular user.

-The administrator can add new products and remove products. Adding products starts the auction, and a timer of 2 minutes starts ticking.

-Regular user and offer the biggest price; clicking the "offer" button, the price increases for 1 euro, and the timer restarts.

If the time off of 2 minutes runs out, the auction closes. ï»¿

I didn't make a sign-in page, users must be added directly in the database.

Patterns used:

-MVVM.

-Mediator.

-Singleton.
